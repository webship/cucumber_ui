# Cucumber UI

Cucumber UI is a powerful automated testing module designed to assist users in effortlessly constructing essential tests for their websites. With its intuitive and user-friendly interface, it empowers users to effortlessly develop desired features and provides a list of steps with examples for reference.

It is necessary to fulfill certain general requirements. These include having the latest version of Chrome driver and Selenium standalone server.

Cucumber UI needs configuration files to function fully, you can install these files by executing the following command on your project:
```
bash <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webship/wbash/v1/cucumber_ui/drupal10.sh)
